Hello, and welcome to my site. I wanted to create a space where I could share all of my favorite memories 
from my travels in hopes of inspiring others to create their own adventure. A couple of years ago, I set 
an ambitious goal to reach 30 countries before 30. On this site, you will find a detailed recounting of 
the trips I have taken so far, my future travel plans, and travel inspiration that keeps me dreaming 
about all the trips I plan to take once I hit the lotto. :)</p>

<h2>The Journey</h2><br>

<p>

<h4>Origins</h4>
    
<p>I started traveling from a young age between New York and Greece when school let out for the year. 
My mother would send me to stay with my grandmother every single summer, since I did not have much to do at home. 
I was too young to appreciate my summers abroad back then, but it really set the stage for the nomadic tendencies 
I developed later on in life.

<p>
In my senior year of high school, my class was informed that our end of year trip had been
cancelled due to lack of funding. One of our teachers created the "International Club" and signed up with EF Tours 
to organize a student-funded trip to Italy and France. My best friend and I signed up, begged our parents for the money,
and set our sights internationally. It felt like a lot of freedom for two 16 year olds to have. Our days were
filled with sight-seeing and exploring. We wandered the streets of places like Milan, Florence, 
Venice, Pisa, Paris, Nice, and Monaco like we knew where we were going. We were bewildered by it all. It was
such a special gift to get to enjoy that trip together as teenagers who were just getting their first glimpse at the world. <br><br>

<h4>The (Travel) Bug</h4>

That first trip to Europe was amazing, but I did feel guilty about making my mom pay for it. I swore that once I got
a job that paid better, I would save up and travel once more. Once in college, I got a part time job that was paying me $13
an hour, which seemed like a lot back then. I managed to save enough to finally take a trip to Mexico in my third year.
That trip was incredible. I snorkeled, I swam with dolphins, and I had shrimp tacos that were so spicy, they permanently
damaged my taste buds (worth it.).

<p>From then on, my only goal became: save enough to travel, then go! Since then, I have traveled all over North 
America, South America, Europe, and Asia. With every trip, I learned a little more about being a savvy and budget-conscious
traveler. I became a better planner, more proficient with navigating, and getting lost, over time, stopped being terrifying
and started becoming an adventure.  </p>

<p><h4>The Goal</h4>
Why 30 countries before 30? Great question. I don't really know. Perhaps I set this goal for myself so that I did not lose
momentum, or make excuses, or turn into one of those "I'll travel when I retire" kind of people. When I finally reach 30, will
I be satisfied? No, probably not. The truth is, the more I travel, the deeper I want to go, the more I want to challenge myself.
Most people seek all-inclusive stress-free beach vacations and I seek the stress. I try the weird street food without question.
I go places where I don't speak the language. These are all things that excite me. For now, 30 countries before 30 is still
the goal at hand. I am currently at 26 countries with one more year to go. This site is broken down by where I've been, where
I'm going, and where I'd like to go one day as a seasoned traveling guru. Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy your
visit.

<br><br>

<a href="https://www.skyscanner.com/"><b>SkyScanner</b></a> - My FAVORITE website to search flight prices. Skyscanner has a unique feature that allows you to search your origin to "anywhere", so whether you are looking for a quick weekend getaway or are plotting an adventure in the future and want to research ticket prices and trends, this website is a key tool to use!
<br><br>

<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/"><b>Lonely Planet</b></a> - Ever since company founders Tony and Maureen Wheeler stapled together their first guidebook after an epic trip across Asia, Lonely Planet has put travellers at the heart of everything we do, informing and inspiring them with trusted content for print and digital from experts who visit every destination. The site has turned into a great resource for introductory and seasoned travelers alike. It promotes travel writing, photography, and community. It is a wonderful resource to get started and find inspiration for your next trip!

<u>Favorite Travel Blogs</u>:<br>

<a href="http://www.offassignment.com/"><b>Off Assignment</b></a> - It's a platform for reflective travel writing. With travel media getting more and more commercial, 
it's nice to have a place where professionals can get into the real stories inherent in a foreign encounter. It's retro and forward-thinking in the right ways. The Letters to a Stranger section is equally heartwarming and haunting. The Triptionary section makes for a lunch-break laugh.
<br><br>

<a href="https://www.freshoffthegrid.com/"><b>Fresh Off the Grid</b></a> - This is the work of Megan McDuffie and Michael Van Vliet as they share their life on the road (in an old Ford Focus) along with fantastic guides and recipes that cater to backpackers, road-trippers, and campers. The site proves that outdoor cooking can go way beyond just burgers. The sheer variety of what this couple can make on to go - from chicken marbella to vegan kebab tacos - makes us eager to gather around the campfire.

<br><br>

<a href="https://www.lostwithpurpose.com/"><b>Lost With Purpose</b></a> - Alex and Sebastiaan visit lesser-known regions of the world and tell vivid stories about their experiences. Their images are incredible and the stories shared in their captions are moving. The stories are personal and helpful â€” particularly for hard-to-reach-places like Uzbekistan or Georgia or Iran.

<b>Tips! </b><br><br>
Google Maps - there is a feature that allows you to create maps of your "favorite" starred places and you can access it while offline. I will typically focus in on a city that I am visiting and star all the places with great reviews, so if I find myself in the area and I am hungry, thirsty, or looking for something fun to do, I always have options!
<br><br>

Explore various applications/websites to find things that suit your tastes. There is no "one size fits all" travel plan. You have to find what works for you, learn by experience, and most importantly, have fun exploring and stumbling.. it is all a part of the experience!
